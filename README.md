# VVKH - Liar's Dice App

This is an application that was scaffolded off of the T3 Stack [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/)
This project aims to get me familiar with the stack and to explore the possiblities of a web-based platform for family and friends to get together and have some friendly fun.

## The tool stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)
- [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/)
- [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) -- haven't decided where to transition into later, GitHub? AWS? GCP?
